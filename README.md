# Donation Campaign

Donation Campaign is a simple react project where we are exploring react router as well as implementing color using json fake data.



#### Add at least 3 Project features:

* **Card representation with category and title:**  
     Users can see the available donation cards that are presenting category and title. Each donation card has a functionality  allowing users to add the card to donation page.if users try to add same card more than one time then it will show a sweet alert to prevent.


* **Navbar and Search Functionality:**  
    Here users easily can go to home ,donation and statistics page by using navbar.Moreover, users can view the card by searching according to the category of their choice.

* **statistics Pie Chart:**    
    Users can easily understand the difference between the total donation and their own donation by looking at the statistics pie chart.

* **Save to localstorage:**  
    Users data will be stored in localstorage so that users can easily understand what they have donated before.
